# GetSelectedSwift

This package simply rebundles the dependency tree from https://github.com/tisfeng/SelectedTextKit
at [b4a19071f3d2661dc1dd673e2a9206320a2f0484](https://github.com/tisfeng/SelectedTextKit/commit/b4a19071f3d2661dc1dd673e2a9206320a2f0484) to be in one file.

This library contains the resulting library with the single public function `getSelected() async throws` as well as an executable target which just calls it.

The dependencies bundled here are:
